# Analysis

## Layer 2, Head 7

In this head, I can clearly see how mask word is highly paying attention on the 4 words surrounding it (2 on each side). E.G. in the first sentence, it pays attention to 'when', 'my', 'came'; and for second sentence, 'studying', 'because', 'is', 'hard'.

Example Sentences:
- I was playing videogames when my [MASK] came.
- I am very frustrated of studying because [MASK] is hard.

## Layer 4, Head 10

This head highly pays attention to the noun that comes after it. Since I intentionally wrote sentences where adjectives are the masks that follows nouns, I can clearly say that this head is about relationshion between adjectives and nouns. 

Example Sentences:
- My mom bought me a [MASK] dress.
- When I came to school, my teacher gave me [MASK] word.
